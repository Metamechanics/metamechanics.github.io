	- # FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS
	- by Immanuel Kant
		- ### PREFACE

		  **Main Argument**: A pure metaphysic of morals must be separated from empirical philosophy to establish the true foundation of moral principles.

		  **Key Supporting Points**:
		- Philosophy divides into material (physics/ethics) and formal (logic) branches
		- Pure philosophy derives doctrines from a priori principles alone, while empirical philosophy bases itself on experience
		- Moral laws must carry absolute necessity and universal validity for all rational beings
		- The basis of moral obligation must be sought a priori in pure reason, not in human nature or empirical circumstances
		- A metaphysic of morals is necessary to investigate the sources of practical principles and prevent corruption of moral concepts
	- ### FIRST SECTION: TRANSITION FROM COMMON RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO PHILOSOPHICAL

	  **Main Argument**: The only thing unconditionally good is a good will, and moral worth derives from acting from duty rather than inclination.
	- #### The Good Will

	  **Supporting Reasoning**:
	- Intelligence, talents, and gifts of fortune can become harmful without a good will to guide them
	- A good will is good in itself, not because of what it accomplishes
	- Even if a good will achieves nothing, it would still shine like a jewel with inherent value
	- #### Acting from Duty vs. Inclination

	  **Key Points**:
	- Actions have moral worth only when done from duty, not from inclination
	- Examples demonstrate the distinction: the honest tradesman (self-interest), preserving life (duty vs. inclination), beneficence (genuine moral worth only when done from duty despite lack of natural sympathy)
	- #### Three Propositions about Duty
	- **First**: Actions have moral worth only when done from duty
	- **Second**: Moral worth derives from the maxim/principle, not the intended result
	- **Third**: Duty is acting from respect for law itself

	  **The Categorical Imperative**: "Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law."
	- ### SECOND SECTION: TRANSITION FROM POPULAR MORAL PHILOSOPHY TO METAPHYSIC OF MORALS

	  **Main Argument**: Moral principles must be derived purely a priori from reason, not from experience, to have universal validity.
	- #### The Need for Pure Moral Philosophy

	  **Supporting Points**:
	- We cannot find certain examples of actions done purely from duty in experience
	- Moral laws must be valid for all rational beings with absolute necessity
	- Examples cannot provide the conception of morality but must be tested by moral principles
	- Pure rational knowledge must be separated from empirical elements
	- #### Imperatives and the Will

	  **Categories of Imperatives**:
	- **Hypothetical**: Command action as means to an end (skill, prudence)
	- **Categorical**: Command action as necessary in itself (morality)

	  **The Will and Rational Beings**:
	- Rational beings act according to conception of laws (principles)
	- Perfect will would automatically conform to objective laws
	- Imperfect will (human) experiences objective laws as obligations/imperatives
	- #### Formulations of the Categorical Imperative
	- **Universal Law**: "Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law"
	- **Humanity as End**: "So act as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as means only"
	- **Kingdom of Ends**: Act as a legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends

	  **Examples Applied**: Suicide, false promises, developing talents, helping others
	- #### Autonomy vs. Heteronomy

	  **Autonomy**: The will gives law to itself - the only source of moral obligation
	  **Heteronomy**: The will seeks its law from external sources - leads to hypothetical imperatives only
	- ### THIRD SECTION: TRANSITION FROM METAPHYSIC OF MORALS TO CRITIQUE OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON

	  **Main Argument**: Freedom is the key to understanding moral autonomy, and the categorical imperative is possible because rational beings belong to both sensible and intelligible worlds.
	- #### The Concept of Freedom

	  **Key Points**:
	- Freedom is not mere absence of determination but positive causality according to self-imposed laws
	- A free will and a will subject to moral laws are identical
	- Freedom must be presupposed as property of all rational beings
	- #### Two Standpoints

	  **Sensible World**: Subject to natural laws and empirical determination
	  **Intelligible World**: Subject to laws of reason and moral autonomy

	  **Resolution**: Rational beings necessarily regard themselves from both perspectives, explaining how categorical imperatives are possible
	- #### Limits of Practical Philosophy

	  **Final Points**:
	- We cannot explain how freedom itself is possible or how pure reason can be practical
	- We can only show that the categorical imperative is necessary if we presuppose freedom
	- The ultimate ground of moral interest remains incomprehensible to human reason
	- This incomprehensibility is itself comprehensible and represents the proper limit of philosophical inquiry
	- ### CONCLUDING REMARK

	  **Summary**: While we cannot comprehend the practical necessity of the moral imperative, we comprehend its incomprehensibility, which is all that can be demanded of philosophy operating at the limits of human reason.

	- # Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals by Immanuel Kant
	- ## Preface

	  **Main Thesis**: A pure metaphysic of morals must be established independently of all empirical elements to provide the foundation for moral philosophy.
	- ### Division of Philosophy
	- **Formal philosophy** (logic): Concerns the form of understanding and universal laws of thought
	- **Material philosophy**: Deals with determinate objects and their laws
		- **Physics**: Laws of nature (what does happen)
		- **Ethics**: Laws of freedom (what ought to happen)
	- ### Core Argument for Pure Moral Philosophy

	  **Key Concept**: **A priori principles** - Knowledge derived from reason alone, independent of experience

	  **Reasoning**:
	- Moral laws must carry absolute necessity to be the basis of obligation
	- The precept "Thou shalt not lie" must be valid for all rational beings, not just humans
	- Therefore, moral principles cannot be derived from human nature or empirical circumstances
	- A metaphysic of morals is indispensable to investigate the a priori sources of practical principles
	- ### Methodological Approach

	  **Analytical method**: Proceeding from common rational knowledge to ultimate principles, then synthetically returning to common knowledge
	- ## First Section: Transition from Common Rational Knowledge to Philosophical

	  **Central Thesis**: Nothing can be called good without qualification except a good will.
	- ### The Good Will

	  **Key Concept**: **Good Will** - A will that acts from duty alone, independent of inclinations and consequences

	  **Arguments**:
	- **Talents and gifts** (intelligence, courage, etc.) can become bad without a good will
	- **Gifts of fortune** (power, riches, health) can inspire pride and presumption without good will correction
	- A good will is good **in itself**, not because of what it accomplishes
	- ### Duty vs. Inclination

	  **Key Concept**: **Duty** - The necessity of acting from respect for moral law

	  **Three Propositions about Moral Worth**:
	- **First Proposition**: Actions have moral worth only when done from duty, not from inclination
	- **Second Proposition**: Moral worth derives from the maxim determining the action, not from the intended result
	- **Third Proposition**: Duty is acting from respect for law itself

	  **Key Concept**: **Maxim** - The subjective principle of volition that guides individual action
	- ### The Categorical Imperative (First Formulation)

	  **Core Principle**: "Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

	  **Examples Applied**:
	- **Suicide**: A maxim of self-destruction contradicts the purpose of life-preservation
	- **False promises**: Would make promising itself impossible if universalized
	- **Neglecting talents**: Cannot be universally willed by rational beings
	- **Refusing to help others**: Would contradict one's own potential need for help
	- ## Second Section: Transition from Popular Moral Philosophy to Metaphysic of Morals

	  **Main Thesis**: Moral philosophy must rest wholly on its pure part, derived a priori from reason alone.
	- ### Critique of Empirical Approaches

	  **Arguments against empirical moral principles**:
	- Cannot provide examples of actions done purely from duty
	- Moral laws must be valid for all rational beings with absolute necessity
	- Even the "Holy One of the Gospels" must be compared with our a priori ideal of moral perfection
	- ### Types of Imperatives

	  **Key Concept**: **Imperative** - A formula expressing the relation of objective law to a will not necessarily determined by it

	  **Three Categories**:
	- **Hypothetical Imperatives of Skill**: "If you want X, do Y"
	- **Hypothetical Imperatives of Prudence**: Concerning means to happiness
	- **Categorical Imperative**: Commands unconditionally, concerns the form and principle of action
	- ### The Categorical Imperative (Alternative Formulations)

	  **Second Formulation**: "Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature."

	  **Third Formulation**: "So act as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as means only."

	  **Key Concept**: **Rational nature as end in itself** - Rational beings have absolute worth and must never be used merely as means
	- ### Kingdom of Ends

	  **Key Concept**: **Kingdom of Ends** - A systematic union of rational beings under common objective laws where each treats themselves and others as ends in themselves

	  **Fourth Formulation**: Act as a legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends.
	- ### Autonomy vs. Heteronomy

	  **Key Concept**: **Autonomy of the Will** - The property by which the will is a law to itself, independent of external determination

	  **Key Concept**: **Heteronomy** - When the will seeks its determining law outside itself in the character of objects

	  **Core Argument**: Only autonomy can ground categorical imperatives; heteronomy produces only hypothetical imperatives.
	- ## Third Section: Transition from Metaphysic of Morals to Critique of Pure Practical Reason

	  **Central Thesis**: Freedom is the key to explaining the autonomy of the will and the possibility of categorical imperatives.
	- ### Freedom and Autonomy

	  **Key Concept**: **Freedom** - The property of causality that it can be efficient independently of foreign determining causes

	  **Core Connection**: A free will and a will subject to moral laws are identical because:
	- Freedom requires acting according to self-imposed laws
	- The categorical imperative expresses the principle of self-legislation
	- Therefore, freedom necessarily implies moral autonomy
	- ### Two Standpoints

	  **Key Concept**: **World of Sense vs. World of Understanding**
	- **World of Sense**: Where we appear as phenomena subject to natural laws (heteronomy)
	- **World of Understanding**: Where we exist as rational beings subject to laws of reason (autonomy)

	  **Explanation of Categorical Imperatives**:
	- As members of the intelligible world, we would act autonomously
	- As members of the sensible world, we experience this autonomy as an "ought"
	- The categorical imperative bridges these two perspectives
	- ### Limits of Practical Philosophy

	  **Final Thesis**: We can explain that categorical imperatives are possible through the concept of freedom, but we cannot explain how freedom itself is possible.

	  **Key Concept**: **Practical Interest** - Reason's capacity to be practical (determine the will) without deriving motivation from empirical sources

	  **Concluding Recognition**: The necessity of moral law is incomprehensible to human reason, but this incomprehensibility is itself comprehensible and represents the proper limit of moral philosophy.
