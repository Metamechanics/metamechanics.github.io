## Introduction
[[projection|Projection]] makes [[perception]]. The world you see is what you gave it, nothing more than that. But through it is no more than that, it is not less. Therefore, to you it is important. It is the [[witness]] to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition. As a man thinketh, so does he [[perceive]]. Therefore, seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world. Perception is a result and not a [[cause]]. And that is why [[order of difficulty in miracles]] is [[meaningless]]. Everything looked upon with [[vision]] is healed and holy. Nothing perceived without it means anything. And where there is no meaning, there is [[chaos]]. ^ProjectionPerception

Damnation is your [[judgment]] on yourself, and this you will project upon the world. See it as demanded, and all you see is what you did to hurt the [[Son of God]]. If you behold [[disaster]] and [[catastrophe]], you tried to [[crucify]] him. If you see [[Holiness|holiness]] and hope, you joined [[the Will of God]] to set him free. There is no choice that lies between these two decisions. And you will see the witness to the choice you made, and learn from this to recognise which one you chose. The world you see but shows you how much [[Joy|joy]] you have allowed yourself to see in you, and to accept as yours. And, if this is its meaning, then the [[power]] to give it joy must lie [[within]] you.
