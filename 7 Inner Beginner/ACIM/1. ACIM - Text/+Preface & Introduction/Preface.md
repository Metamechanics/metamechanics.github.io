# Preface
## How it Came
A Course in Miracles began with the sudden decision of two people to join in a common goal. Their names were [[Helen Schucman]] and [[William Thetford]], Professors of Medical Psychology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. It does not matter who they were, except that the story shows that with God all things are possible. They were anything but [[spiritual]]. Their [[relationship]] with each other was difficult and often strained, and they were concerned with personal and professional acceptance and status. In general, they had considerable investment in the [[values]] of [[the world]] . Their lives were hardly in accord with anything that the Course advocates. Helen, the one who received the material, describes herself:

> Psychologist, educator, conservative in theory and atheistic in belief, I was working in a prestigious and highly academic setting. And then something happened that triggered a chain of events I could never have predicted. The head of my department unexpectedly announced that he was tired of the angry and aggressive feelings our attitudes reflected, and concluded that "[[there must be another way]]." As if on cue, I agreed to help him find it. Apparently this Course is the other way.

Although their intention was serious, they had great difficulty in starting out on their joint venture. But they had given the [[Holy Spirit]] the "[[little willingness]]" that, as the Course itself was to emphasise again and again, is sufficient to enable Him to use any situation for His purposes and provide it with His power. To continue Helen's first-person account:

> Three starting months preceded the actual writing, during which time Bill suggested that I write down the highly symbolic [[dream]] and descriptions of the strange images that were coming to me. Although I had grown more accustomed to the unexpected by that time, I was still very surprised when I wrote, "This is a course in [[miracle|miracles]]." That was my introduction to [[the Voice]] . It made no sound, but seemed to be giving me a kind of rapid, inner dictation which I took down in a shorthand notebook. The writing was never automatic. It could be interrupted at any time and later picked up again. It made me very uncomfortable, but it never seriously occurred to me to stop. It seemed to be a special assignment I had somehow, somewhere agreed to complete. It represented a truly collaborative venture between Bill and myself, and much of its significance, I am sure, lies in that. I would take down what the Voice "said" and read it to him the next day, and he typed it from my dictation. I expect he had his special assignment, too. Without his encouragement and support I would never have been able to fulfil mine. The whole process took about seven years. The Text came first, then the Workbook for Students, and finally the Manual for Teachers. Only a few minor changes have been made. Chapter titles and subheadings have been inserted in the text, and some of the more personal references that occurred at the beginning have been omitted. Otherwise, the material is substantially unchanged.

The names of the collaborators in the recording of [[the Course]] do not appear on the cover because the Course can and should stand on its own. It is not intended to become the basis for another [[cult]]. Its only purpose is to provide a way in. which some people will be able to find their own [[Internal Teacher]].

## What It Is
As its title implies, the Course is arranged throughout as a [[Teaching]] device. It consists of three books: a 669-page [[A Course In Miracles - Text|Text]] , a 488-page  , and a 92-page [[A Course In Miracles - Manual for Teachers|Manual for Teachers]]. The order in which [[student|students]] choose to use the books, and the ways in which they study them, depend on their particular [[needs]] and preferences.

The [[curriculum]] the Course proposes is carefully conceived and is explained, step by step, at both the theoretical and practical level. It emphasises application rather than [[theory]], and experience rather than theology. It specifically states that "a [[universal]] theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary" ( [[Clarification of Terms - Introduction#^f40bb9|Manual, p.77]]. Although [[Christian]] in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasises that it is but one version of the [[universal curriculum]]. There are many others, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end. ^884b5a

The text is largely [[theory|theoretical]], and sets forth the concepts on which the Course's [[thought system]] is based. Its ideas contain the [[foundation]] for the Workbook's lessons. Without the practical application the Workbook provides, the text would remain largely a series of abstractions which would hardly suffice to bring about the [[thought reversal]] at which the Course aims.

The Workbook includes 365 [[+A Course In Miracles - Workbook|lessons]], one for each day of the year. It is not necessary, however, to do the lessons at that tempo, and one might want to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day. The [[instructions]] urge only that not more than one lesson a day should be attempted. The [[practical]] nature of the Workbook is underscored by the introduction to its lessons, which emphasises [[experience]] through application rather than a prior commitment to a spiritual goal:

Finally, the [[A Course In Miracles - Manual for Teachers|Manual for Teachers]], which is written in question and answer form, provides answers to some of the more likely questions a student might ask. It also includes a clarification of a number of the terms the Course uses, explaining them within the [[theoretical framework]] of the Text.

[[the Course|The Course]] makes no claim to finality, nor are the [[+A Course In Miracles - Workbook|Workbook]] lessons intended to bring the student's learning to completion. At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own [[Internal Teacher]], Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit. While [[the Course]] is comprehensive in scope, truth cannot be limited to any finite form, as is clearly recognized in the statement at the end of the [[+A Course In Miracles - Workbook|workbook]]:

## What It Says
> _Nothing real can be threatened.
> Nothing unreal exists.
> Herein lies the peace of God._

This is how _A Course In Miracles_ begins. It makes a fundamental distinction between the [[Reality|real]] and the [[unreal]]; between knowledge and perception. [[knowledge|Knowledge]] is truth, under one law, the law of love or God. [[Truth]] is unalterable, [[eternal]] and unambiguous. It can be unrecognised, but it cannot be [[change|changed]]. It applies to everything that God created, and only what He created is real. It is beyond [[learning]] because it is beyond [[time|time]] and process. It has no [[opposite]]; no [[beginning]] and no [[end]]. It merely is.

The world of perception, on the other hand, is the world of time, of change, or beginnings and endings. It is based on [[interpretation]], not on [[facts]]. It is the world of [[birth]] and [[death]], founded on the belief in [[scarcity]], [[loss]], [[Separation]] and death. It is learned rather than given, selective in its perceptual emphases, [[unstable]] in its functioning, and inaccurate in its interpretations.

From knowledge and perception respectively, two distinct [[thought system|thought systems]] arise which are opposite in every respect. In the realm of knowledge no thoughts exist [[apart from God]], because God and His Creation share one Will. The world of perception, however, is made by the belief in opposites and separate wills, in perpetual [[conflict]] with each other and with God. What perception sees and hears appears to be real because it permits into awareness only what confirms to the [[wish|wishes]] of the perceiver. This leads to a world of [[illusion|illusions]], a world which needs constant [[defense]] precisely _because_ it is not real.

When you have been caught in the world of perception you are caught in a [[dream]]. You cannot escape without help, because everything your [[senses]] show merely [[witness|witnesses]] to the reality of the dream. God has provided the [[Answer]], the only Way out, the true [[Helper]]. It is the function of His Voice, His Holy Spirit, to [[mediate]] between the [[two worlds]]. He can do this because, while on the one hand He knows the truth, on the other He also recognizes our illusions, but without believing in them. It is the Holy Spirit's goal to help us escape from the dream world by teaching us how to [[reverse]] our thinking and [[unlearn]] our mistakes. [[Forgiveness]] is the Holy Spirit's great learning aid in bringing this thought reversal about. However, the Course has its own definition of what forgiveness really is just as it defines the world in its own way.

The world we see merely reflects our own internal frame of reference - the dominant ideas, wishes and emotions in our minds. "[[projection|Projection]] makes [[perception]]." [[Chapter 21 - Reason and Perception#^b7a8fc|(Text, p.445)]]. We look inside first, decide the kind of world we want to see and then projected that world outside, making it the truth _as we see it_. We make it true by our interpretations of what it is we are seeing. If we are using perception to [[justify]] our own mistakes - our [[anger]], our [[impulses]] to [[attack]], our [[lack of love]] in whatever form it may take - we will see a world of [[evil]], destruction, malice, envy and [[despair]]. All this we must learn to forgiven, not because we are being "good" and "charitable," but because what we are seeing is not true. We have [[distortion|distorted]] the world by our twisted [[defense|defenses]], and are therefore seeing what is not there. As we learn to recognize our perceptual [[error|errors]], we also learn to look past them or "forgive." At the same time we are forgiving ourselves, looking past our distorted self-concepts to the Self That God created in us and as us.

[[sin|Sin]] is defined as "lack of love" [[T-1.IV. The Escape From Darkness#^818cee|Text, p.11]] Since [[love]] is all there is, sin in the sight of the Holy Spirit is a [[mistake]] to be corrected, rather than an evil to be punished. Our sense of [[inadequacy]], [[weakness]] and incompletion comes from the strong investment in the "[[scarcity]] principle" that governs the whole world of illusions. From that point of view, we [[seek]] in others what we feel is wanting in ourselves. We "love" another in order to get something ourselves. That, in fact, is what passes for love in the dream world. There can be no greater mistake than that, for love is incapable of asking for anything.

Only minds can really [[join]], and whom God has joined no man put asunder ([[T-17.III. Shadows of the Past#^a40c24|Text, p.356]]). It is, however, only at the level of [[Christ Mind]] that true [[union]] is possible, and has, in fact, never been lost. The "little I" seeks to enhance itself by external [[approval]], external possessions and external "love." The Self That God created [[needs]] nothing. It is forever complete, safe, loved and loving. It seeks to share rather than to get; to [[extension|extend]] rather than [[projection|project]]. It has no needs and wants to join with others out of their mutual awareness of abundance.

The [[special relationship|special relationships]] of the world are destructive, selfish and childishly egocentric. Yet, if given to the Holy Spirit, these relationships can become the holiest things on earth - the miracles that point the way to the return to Heaven. The world uses its special relationships as a final [[weapon]] of exclusion and a demonstration of [[Separation|separateness]]. The Holy Spirit transforms them into perfect lessons in [[Forgiveness]] and in [[awake|awakening]] from the dream. Each one is an [[opportunity]] to let perceptions be healed and errors corrected. Each one is another chance to forgive oneself by forgiving the other. And each one becomes still another [[invitation]] to the Holy Spirit and to remembrance of [[God]].

[[perception|Perception]] is a function of the [[body]], and therefore represent a limit on [[awareness]]. Perception sees through the body's eyes and hears through the body's ears. It evokes the limited responses which the body makes. The body appears to be largely self-motivated and independent, yet it actually responds only to the intentions of the [[mind]]. If the mind wants to use it for [[attack]] in any form, it becomes prey to [[sickness]], age and decay. If the mind accepts the Holy Spirit's purpose for it instead, it becomes a useful way of communicating with others, [[invulnerable]] as long as it is needed, and to be gently laid by when its use is over. Of itself it is neutral, as is everything in the world of perception. Whether it is used for the goals of the ego or the [[Holy Spirit]] depends entirely on what the mind wants.

The [[opposite]] of seeing through the body's eyes is the [[vision of Christ]], which reflects [[strength]] rather than [[weakness]], [[unity]] rather than [[Separation|separation]], and love rather than fear. The opposite of hearing through the body's ears is communication through the [[Voice for God]], the Holy Spirit, which abides in each of us. His Voice seems distant and difficult to hear because the ego, which speaks for the little, separated self, seems to be much louder. This is actually reversed. The Holy Spirit speaks with unmistakable clarity and overwhelming appeal. No one who does not choose to identify with the body could possibly be deaf to His messages of release and [[hope]], nor could he fail to accept joyously the vision of Christ in glad exchange for this miserable picture of himself.

Christ's vision is the Holy Spirit's [[gift]], God's [[alternative]] to the illusion of separation and to the belief in the reality of sin, [[guilt]] and death. It is the one [[correction]] for all errors of perception; the reconciliation of the seeming opposites on which this world is based. Its kindly light shows all things from another point of view, reflecting the thought system that arises from knowledge and making [[return to God]] not only possible but [[inevitable]]. What was regarded as injustices done to one by someone else now becomes a call for help and for union. Sin, sickness and attack are seen as [[misperception]] calling for [[remedy]] through [[gentleness]] and love. Defenses are laid down because where there is no attack there is no need for them. Our brothers' needs become our own, because they are taking the [[journey]] with us as we go to God. Without us thy would lose their way. Without them we could never find our own.

Forgiveness is unknown in [[Heaven]], where the need for it would be inconceivable. However, in this world, forgiveness is a necessary correction for all the mistakes that we have made. To offer forgiveness is the only way for us to have it, for it reflects the law of Heaven that giving and receiving are the same. Heaven is the natural state of all the Sons of God as He created them. Such is their reality forever. It has not changed because it has been forgotten.

Forgiveness is the [[means]] by which we will remember. Through forgiveness the thinking of the world is reversed. The forgiven world becomes the gate of Heaven, because by its mercy we can at last forgive ourselves. Holding no one prisoner to guilt, we become free. Acknowledging Christ in all our brothers, we recognize His Presence in ourselves. Forgetting all our misperceptions, and with nothing from the past to hold us back, we can [[remember]] God. Beyond this, learning cannot go. When we are [[ready]], God Himself will take the [[final]] [[step]] in our return to Him.
