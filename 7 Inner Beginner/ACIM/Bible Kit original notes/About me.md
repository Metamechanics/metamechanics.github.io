# About me
Hi! 👋 My name is Adam. 

## My Spiritual Journey

## My PKM journey
After stumbling over a video extorting the virtues of reading I set myself the goal of reading 50 books in 2020. 

A goal that I was able to exceed (a global pandemic surely freed up more time than expected). With all those books read, I started taking a ton of notes that I needed to store somehow. My traditional approach of scattered, just-in-time notes didn't cut it anymore. I quickly identified [[The shortcomings of common note-taking practices]].

Reading from some bright minds on the benefits of note-*making*, I stumbled into the world of PKM and was amazed by the [[Benefits of Connected Biblical Thinking]] and the potential it offered for orienting my life around scripture (See: [[God-centered life]]).
