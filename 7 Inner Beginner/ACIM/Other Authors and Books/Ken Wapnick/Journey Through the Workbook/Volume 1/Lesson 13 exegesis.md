[It is not just that it upset you, it make you [[fearful]].]
This is because you do not want to realize that what you perceive has no meaning. Once again, if what I see out there in the world has no meaning, the thought within me that gave rise to it has no meaning either. Since I _am_ my thoughts, it follows that _I_ do not have any meaning, which means _I_ do not exist. Therefore, rather than realize everything is meaningless, within and without, I will substitute my own meaning. Obviously, if I perceive something I think is out there, which affects me, I have already pronounced it real. And I want to keep the underlying thought real so _I_ can continue to be real.

>![[Lesson 13. A meaningless world engenders fear.#^695532]]

The anxiety arise because at some level I realize that the meaningless extends to _my_ existence. This ide will be returned to very shortly.

The ego challenges, but God does not; that is why the word is in quotes. to the ego, then, competition is the nature of its relationship with God. And "empty space" exists because the ego is nothing. Yet it believes it must get to the emptiness before God, to claim the Son's identity as its won; thus the perceived competition with the Creator. If my existence as an ego is prediaged on the blief in _one or the other_ - I exist at God's expense; I killed Him so I can live - I will project that thought and believe He is doing the same thing back to me. This deeply rooted belief is th esource of our perception that people are out to get us, to hurt, abandon, and saborage us, because we accused ourselves of the doing the same to others, and ultimately to God. As Jesus states near the end of the text:
>![[T-31.III. The Self-Accused#^49548b]]

>![[Lesson 13. A meaningless world engenders fear.#^695532]]

Namely, that is nothing. The ego knows, as I have explained before, that its power rests in the decision maker, because the ego in and of itself is impotent. to ensure that we never recognise its inherent nothingness and meaninglessness, it seeks to make itself important and powerful through [[sin, guilt, and fear]]. If i have sinned against God and destroyed Him, I am certainly important and powerful. This also makes me [[fearful]], but at least i Have become something that God notices, which also makes me important.

The most frightening thing of all is to realize God does not even know about us, because then we are literally nothing - impotent and unreal. Thus we want God to pay attention to us, either because we are His most devoted follower or the most wretched sinner. It makes no difference to the ego, as long as God takes notice. Our real fear, of course, is that He knows nothing about us. Somewhere deep inside we know that to be true. But rather than accept its truth, we cover it over with the ego's lies; first with the thoughts of separation - sin, guilt and fear - and next with a world that reflects those thoughts.

>![[Lesson 13. A meaningless world engenders fear.#^4ca20e]]

This acceptance comes from developing a relationship with [[Jesus]] or the [[Holy Spirit]] that allows you to look at your ego without fear, helping you realize its meaninglessness. If you are [[fearful]] or guilty about your ego, or if you embrace it, you obviously believe it is real. Once again, however, if you step back and watch this "oddly assorted procession" go by, you realise it is nothing, understanding its meaning lies in trying to protect you for what _is_ meaningful. Finally, since we want that meaningfulness more than anything else - it is our identity as [[Son of God|God's Son]] - we would then realize everything else makes no sense and choose against it.

In this sense we talk about the world as powerful, hostile, threatening, wonderful, peaceful, blissful, holy, etc. These are its attributes; and the "images that do not exist" are everything we see in the world, which are of course the projections of thoughts that do not exist.

Safety devices are defenses. Sin, guilt and fear, and the world that arises from them are illusions, the prupose of which is to preserve the fundamental illusion that I exist as a separate individual.

And now we go to the blockbuster line in the next paragraph:
>![[Lesson 13. A meaningless world engenders fear.#W-pI 13 4]]

We thus go from our mind's thoughts to our bodies' perceptions, and then back within. To state it once again, the world is fundamentally meaningless. Yet we [[strive]] to give it meaning, since that ultimately gives meaning to our separated self. Listening to the ego we make up a thought system of sin, guilt and fear: Our _sin_ of separation leads to the experience of _guilt_, which culminates in the _[[fearful]]_ belief that we deserve to be punished by a vengeful God, who now is in mortal competition with use for existence; either He survives, or we do, or as the manual states: _kill or be killed_ ([[17. How Do God's Teachers Deak With Magic Thoughts#M-17.7|M-17.7]]) But the inherent meaninglessness of this constellation of insanity does not preclude its having tremendous power, for we have invested our belief in it. Such investment means we must strive to give it meaning so we can defend against the ego's meaningless thought system, which is the basis for our meaningless identity.

To summarise this important point: When I realize the world is nothing, since it is simply a defence against my mind's thoughts, I am thrown back to these thoughts. If the world is meaningless and I am meaningless, I do not exist, which means God has won. But rather than lose the battle, I strive to give meaning to myself and to the world around me.

Jesus is helping us realize how we project everything onto the world. If we pay careful attention to our perceptions and what we value here, we would realize none of them comes from anything inherent in the world, because there is no world. They are but the result of a need within ourselves to justify and reinforce the spurious fact that we exist.

>![[Lesson 13. A meaningless world engenders fear.#^319cb5]]

The fear is that this is a [[competition]] we cannot win - God will be victorious. The terror engendered by such insanity is beyond what we can tolerate. We defend against it by constructing a thought system and then a world, behind which we can hide. Having become identified with this defense that culminates in the body, we _resist_ having it taken from us, which exposing its foundation to the truth of the Atonement would surely do. And so we do not think about the wrath of God. That thoughts, as horrifying as it is, nonetheless protects the individual identify, which in turn defends against our acceptance of the Atonement.

>![[Lesson 13. A meaningless world engenders fear.#^319cb5]]

Obviously, if you are relatively new to _A Course In Miracles_, this statement will make no sense. But Jesus is asking for your [[vigilance]], that you pay careful attention to any anxiety or fear that is within you.

>![[Lesson 13. A meaningless world engenders fear.#W-pI 13 6]]

The cause and effect connection is between our thoughts - the ego's thought system of sin, guilt, and fear - and the way we perceive the world. In other words, I am [[fearful]] _not_ because of what is outside me, but because of my thought system, which tells me that [[survival]] is between God and me. Note, too, how Jesus does not confront or attack our resistance. He simply and gently reminds us of the truth. This allows us to accept it when we are ready, without any pressure or guilt inflicted on us. A wonderful example of all Course students!
