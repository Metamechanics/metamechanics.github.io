Lines like these are frequently used by students of _A Course In Miracles_ as a way to dilute the metaphysics and claim that the Course does _not_ say that God did not create the world. Ratehr they claim the the Course teaches only that God did not create the world we _see_. It is true that the words of some statements say just that, but only because Jesus is teaching us to pay carefuul attention to waht we perceive. He makes it abundantly clear both in teh workdook , as well as many, may other places in the rest of the material that God could not have created the world because it is His opposite. (See, for example, T-4.I.11; T-29.VI.2:7; W-pI.132.4; W-pI.152.5; C-4.1.) Everything in the world of specifics and form changes and dies. Such a world is outside God, and therefore could not exist.

The very fact that we _perceive_ the world means it is unreal, and also that we are unreal. Again, this does not mean just the world we see. Students cometimes mistakenly think this means, for example, that God did not create the cancer I am perceiving. The very fact that I see a world at all is saying there is a relatity outside God; if I perceive a word, ther emust be a perceier and a perceived, subject and object, oberserver and observed, which means we are rooted in duality. God can create only like Himself, which means a Being or Spirit of perfect Oneness and Love, changeles and eternal. In other words what God did not create does not exist, and and everything that does exist, exists as He created it - the state of Heaven.

Again, Jesus exerts no pressur eon us. The fourth sentence is an interesting one, because our comfort can also be due to our _not_ understanding, as we are so afraid of this very purpose of retraining our minds, which these periods of mind searching will bring about In this instance our "comfort" wouuld be a spurious one, which is not Jesus' point here.

Jesus is helping us understand ther eis a specific motivation involved in holding onto our thoughts. They do not come and go as if by magic, a phrase used later ([[Lesson 158. Today I learn to give as I receive.|W-pI.158.4]]); they do not just appear. For example, when I am trying to be quiet in order to meditate and pray, and all of a sudden extraneous, distracting thoughts arise, thhey do not come out of nowhere. they come because I am afraid of the love and peace that arise in my ind if I am quiet. I tehrefore quickly have to substittue _my_ thoghts instead of Jesus' thoughts, my expereince of specialness rather than the experience of his love.

What is important and clearly implied here is that htere is a specific motivation for the way I perceive the world and the thoughts that give rise to it. I fi cna release those thoughts, which occurs when I ask Jesus for help in looking at them, they will disappear. What is left is the Word of God, which, as defined earlie, is the principle of the Atonement that say sthat eh separation never happened.

[The above passage] is the first time Jesus makes such a statement in the lessons. More [statements] will follow, and they are found throughout the text and manual as well - forgiveness is a difficult process, and cannot but arouse tremendous fear (e.g. [[T-27.VII. The Dreamer of the Dream.#^ef7194|T-27.VII.13]])
