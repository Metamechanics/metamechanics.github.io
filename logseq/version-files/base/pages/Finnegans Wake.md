- There is one phrase in Finnegans Wake that seems to me to epitomize the whole sense of Joyce. He says, "Oh Lord, heap mysteries upon us, but entwine our work with laughter low." And this is the sense of the Buddhist [[bodhisattva]] : joyful participation in the sorrows of the world. #[[Joseph Campbell]]
