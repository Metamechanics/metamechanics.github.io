	- # Orientation of Latin-American Pyramids and Temples: A Study of Magnetic Pole Correlation
	  
	  **Author:** Mario Buildreps
	  
	  **Version:** 2.0, April 2018
	- ## Abstract
	  
	  This study analyzes 157 archaeological sites (263 buildings) across Latin America to test whether ancient structures were oriented using magnetic compasses. The research challenges previous assumptions that non-cardinal orientations resulted from magnetic pole orientation.
	  
	  **Key Findings:**
	- 90% of structures are oriented East of True North (clockwise)
	- Only 15.6% of buildings correlate with magnetic pole positions
	- No systematic relationship exists between structural orientation and magnetic pole wandering
	- ## Introduction
	  
	  Previous researchers (Fuson 1969, Carlson 1975, Klokočník 2010) suggested Latin American pyramids and temples were oriented using lodestone compasses toward the magnetic pole. This study provides comprehensive analysis contradicting this hypothesis.
	  
	  **Research Scope:**
	- 157 sites from Mexico to Peru
	- 263 individual structures analyzed
	- Comparison with historical magnetic pole positions (1000 BC - 1500 AD)
	- ## Methodology
	  
	  **Data Collection:**
	- Wikipedia as primary source for GPS coordinates
	- Google Earth measurements for orientation analysis
	- Buildings measured as squares/rectangles within 90° range
	- No assumptions about "front" or "main" sides
	  
	  **Analysis Approach:**
	- Structures grouped into two major clusters:
		- Mesoamerican cluster: +17.1° latitude, -92.4° longitude
		- Andean cluster: -11.8° latitude, -75.8° longitude
	- Magnetic pole positions from McElhinny and McFadden (2000)
	- Mathematical correlation using bearing calculations
	- ## Results
	- ### Cluster Analysis
	  
	  ```
	  | Cluster | Average Orientation | Correlation with Magnetic Pole |
	  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
	  | Mesoamerican | +12.8° ±0.35° | 10.6° difference |
	  | Andean | +18.5° ±0.61° | 15.3° difference |
	  ```
	- ### Individual Building Analysis
	- **Total buildings:** 263
	- **Correlating with magnetic pole (±5° error):** 41 (15.6%)
	- **Non-correlating:** 180 (68.4%)
	- **Out of scope (>1000 BC):** 42 (15.9%)
	- ### Alternative Dating Analysis
	  
	  When testing for correlation with magnetic pole positions in other time periods:
	- **Additional correlations found:** 15 buildings (5.7%)
	- **Total possible magnetic orientation:** 56 buildings (21.3%)
	- **Buildings not correlating with any magnetic pole position:** 207 (78.7%)
	- ### Orientation Distribution
	  
	  ```
	  | Orientation Type | Count | Percentage |
	  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
	  | Clockwise oriented | 238 | 90.5% |
	  | Counterclockwise oriented | 15 | 5.7% |
	  | Cardinally oriented | 10 | 3.8% |
	  ```
	- ## Key Evidence Against Magnetic Orientation
	- **Temporal Mismatch:** During supposed construction periods (500-1500 AD), magnetic pole positions would have produced counterclockwise orientations, not the observed clockwise pattern.
	- **Statistical Insignificance:** Only 21.3% of structures could possibly correlate with magnetic pole positions across all time periods.
	- **Geographical Inconsistency:** Both Mesoamerican and Andean clusters show similar clockwise bias despite different magnetic declinations.
	- **Error Magnitude:** Differences between actual and calculated orientations (10.6° and 15.3°) exceed reasonable compass reading errors.
	- ## Conclusion
	  
	  The study conclusively demonstrates that **Latin American pyramids and temples were not oriented using magnetic compasses**. The overwhelming clockwise orientation pattern and lack of correlation with historical magnetic pole positions indicate orientation to "an astronomical or geological phenomenon other than the wandering magnetic pole."
	  
	  **Implications:**
	- Challenges existing theories about ancient navigation methods
	- Suggests sophisticated astronomical knowledge among ancient builders
	- Raises questions about the true rationale behind structural orientations
	  
	  This research provides the most comprehensive analysis to date, examining nearly three times more structures than previous studies and employing rigorous statistical methods to test magnetic orientation hypotheses.
