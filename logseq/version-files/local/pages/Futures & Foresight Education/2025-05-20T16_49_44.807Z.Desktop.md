- ### The Future of Education is Education OF, FOR, ABOUT & BY the future(s).
  Attend a conference or perform a web search on anything to do with **'the future of education'** and you will generally see either a survey of trends in pedagogy, emphasis on the role of 'tech' or a prescription for a curriculum that meets one particular view (preference, guess) of the future. While many ideas are valuable, insightful and creative, the proposals generally take a one-dimensional, shallow and/or narrow view of education as well as of 'the future'. We must move to more robust multi-dimensional models of education with respect to the future. We must teach youth to be futurists in their own right since our dreams are not theirs, and our forecasts will be outdated by the time they arrive. To prepare for the future, we must teach Futures Thinking.
