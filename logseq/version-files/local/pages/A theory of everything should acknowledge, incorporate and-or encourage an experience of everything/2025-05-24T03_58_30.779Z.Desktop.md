- Why? Why should this be the case?
- The observer must be part of the observed, if we are talking about 'everything'. These are not theories of "everything but me and my observation process"
- All the 'apprehension modes' should be included and employed: the five senses and their technological extensions, as well as the extra-senses that are poorly acknowledged by orthodoxy.
- The literature is abundant with reports of feelings of 'expansion', 'wholeness', 'oneness', loss of boundary (in an uplifting way, not a mundane )
- My subject is someone else's object. Me as an observer is someone else's 'observed'.
