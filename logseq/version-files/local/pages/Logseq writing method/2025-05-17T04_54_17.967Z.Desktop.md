- Tag heavily
	- update [[Metamechanic ontology]] routinely
- Write pages as short blocks then 'page embed' or 'block embed' so I can fold them #[[block writing]]
- Don't make pages too long
	- what is the guidance here?
	- Pages often should have 1 sub-level max. This allows for more efficient page embedding
	- Where is the length limit?
		- Single bullet point/node like Tana is too short
		- Long-form (like Obsidian) is not the style I'm after either
- Ask myself at each point: what is the smallest block that will make sense by itself?
	- {{embed ((678ae851-1659-4b1a-9a22-8d821a32df1f))}}
- Answer questions
	- Have a clear research question and sub-questions for each task
	- Write to these questions
- Use markdown headings
- What are the types of block that can be written?
  Can all (non-fiction) writing be broken down to types of argumentative structures?
	- Claim, counter-claim
	- fact, data
	- qualification (as in conditions, )
	- Example, evidence; or should
	- Premise, assumption, axiom, assertion
	- Relationships
		- Degree of agreement
		- Elaboration, expansion
		- Evidence, Example
- A block should be a paragraph with a summary sentence as heading
	- TEXAS paragraph? TEXEXAS
- Blocks require metadata
