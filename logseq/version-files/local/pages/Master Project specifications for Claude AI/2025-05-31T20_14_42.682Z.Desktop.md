- # Development Workflow Procedures
	- ## Claude Conversation Management
		- ### Conversation Types
			- Master Setup: This conversation - establishing systems and procedures
			- Project-Specific: One conversation per major project (Universal Schema, DiaGnosis, etc.)
			- Development Journal: Weekly progress summaries across all projects
			- Quick Help: Short technical questions that don't need full context
		- ### Starting New Conversations
			- Always paste Master Project Specifications first
			- Add relevant workflow procedures if needed
			- Reference related conversations: "Building on my Universal Schema conversation..."
			- State specific goal clearly at the start
		- ### Conversation Maintenance
			- Pin important conversations (Master Setup, Universal Schema, Development Journal)
			- Archive completed quick-help conversations to reduce clutter
			- Update Master Specifications when major decisions are made
	- ## Repository Structure & Version Control
		- ### Repository Organization
			- Option A: Monorepo with folders for each project
			- Option B: Separate repositories per major project
			- Decision needed: Choose based on schema integration complexity
		- ### Naming Conventions
			- Projects: lowercase-with-hyphens (e.g., diagnosis-app, acim-concordance)
			- Branches: feature/description, fix/description, schema/update-v2
			- Commits: Clear action descriptions ("Add concept mapping entities to schema")
		- ### Claude Code Integration
			- Grant Claude access to primary development repositories
			- Use for code generation, debugging, and cross-project consistency checks
			- Let Claude suggest repository structure improvements
		- ### Version Control for Schema
			- Schema changes get their own branch and careful review
			- Document all schema changes in Development Journal
			- Test schema changes against existing projects before merging
	- ## Documentation Workflow
		- ### Information Flow
			- Claude Conversations → decisions and code snippets
			- Logseq → quick capture of decisions, daily progress, templates
			- Obsidian → comprehensive project documentation, architecture decisions
			- Repository README files → project-specific setup and usage instructions
		- ### Update Procedures
			- Daily: Capture key decisions in Logseq bullet points
			- Weekly: Update Development Journal conversation with progress summary
			- Major Decisions: Update Master Specifications template
			- Code Solutions: Save working code snippets in both Logseq and repository
		- ### Templates for Documentation
			- Decision Record: Problem → Options → Choice → Rationale
			- Code Snippet: Context → Code → Usage Notes → Integration Points
			- Learning Note: What I learned → How it applies → Next steps
	- ## Project Dependency Management
		- ### Schema-Dependent Projects
			- Universal Schema is the foundation - changes here affect everything
			- Procedure: Schema updates require testing against all dependent projects
			- Communication: Document schema changes in Development Journal before implementing
		- ### Cross-Project Integration
			- DiaGnosis embeds in websites → shared component library needed
			- PDF Processor feeds all projects → consistent output format required
			- ACIM tools share processed text → common text processing standards
		- ### Dependency Update Workflow
			- Identify all affected projects before making changes
			- Update projects in dependency order (schema → tools → websites → apps)
			- Test integrations after each update
			- Document breaking changes and migration steps
	- ## Testing & Integration Procedures
		- ### Schema Integration Testing
			- Test that all projects can read from schema
			- Test that updates to schema don't break existing functionality
			- Verify cross-references between projects work correctly
		- ### Embedding Testing
			- Test DiaGnosis embedding in different website contexts
			- Verify PDF processor output integrates with schema correctly
			- Check that shared components render consistently
		- ### Data Consistency Testing
			- Verify same entities appear consistently across projects
			- Test that relationship updates propagate correctly
			- Check that content references resolve properly
	- ## AI Agent Integration Strategy
		- ### Current State
			- Using Claude through web interface primarily
			- Expanding to Claude API for automation
			- Planning Claude Code integration for development assistance
		- ### Future AI Agent Roles
			- Documentation Maintainer: Auto-update documentation from code changes
			- Cross-Project Monitor: Identify when changes in one project affect others
			- Schema Validator: Check that new content follows schema correctly
			- Integration Tester: Automated testing of cross-project functionality
		- ### Agent Implementation Approach
			- Start with simple automation (documentation updates)
			- Gradually add more complex agents as needs become clear
			- Always maintain human oversight and approval for significant changes
		- ### Agent Communication
			- Agents should update Development Journal with their activities
			- Significant agent recommendations should be discussed in project conversations
			- Agent-generated code should be reviewed before integration
	- ## Community Preparation Notes
		- ### Future Considerations
			- Access Control: Schema subsets for different collaborator levels
			- Contribution Guidelines: Standards for community content and code
			- Moderation Tools: Systems for managing community-generated content
			- Documentation Standards: Public-facing documentation separate from development notes
		- ### Current Preparations
			- Build with clear separation between private development notes and public documentation
			- Design schema to support multiple content creators and moderators
			- Create consistent coding standards that others can follow
			- Document decision-making processes for future transparency
