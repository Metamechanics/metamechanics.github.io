	- A tenet of this work is that the universe is not founded on "everything-ness". Rather the universe is founded on:
		- An deceptive appearance of coherence interspersed with incoherence
		- A tendency to short-memory - regular forgettings of the incoherence interspersed with periods of apparent coherence
		- "This time its different".
	- [[a universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is necessary]]
	- [[A theory of everything should acknowledge, incorporate and-or encourage an experience of everything]]
	- Materialist theories of everything deprecate the very mind which generates the theory.
		- Here is an explanation of X. [In my explanation] The thoughts and thinking behind it [that produced my explanation] are epiphenomena, results of randomness, unreal, inconsequential,
		- They completely dismiss the power that produced them: the mind and mental processes. Ignore. Devalue.
	- In an authentic scientific sense, in an exploration for a theory of "everything" one can't first limit the scope of "everything" without returning to examine those assumptions.
	- Orthodox, dominant (ie. materialist) theories of everything start at one end of the spectrum: the material is real, and only the material. AMT starts at the other end of the spectrum: God is real, and only God and Its Creations are real. Yet the difference is AMT is not pre-defining what God is whereas TOEs implicitly define materiality to be real without questioning this.
		- The questioning of materiality leads to other TOEs which incorporate consciousness as a legitimate element, aspect, factor and/or feature. These tend to be far more compelling, explanatory and ultimately useful than the materially-dominated theories. AMT will refer to some of these and comment on them.
- A "framework" rather than a "theory".
