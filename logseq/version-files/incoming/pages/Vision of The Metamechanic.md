- Notes to self
  collapsed:: true
	- integrate and link to my existing notes on this topic here, but don't embed; this needs to be a stand-alone document for AI upload.
	- unify
- ## Purpose of this document
	- This document is a baseline outline in order for Claude AI to assist and augment the planning, organisation, development, execution and operation of my vision and mission.
	- This vision and mission encompasses all aspects of my life with a particular focus on the vocational identity, the Metamechanic, and its projects and ideas. However, I would to emphasise that any and all success and enjoyment as the Metamechanic is grounded first and foremost in my spiritual life, and secondly, in regular, consistent physical exercise and fitness activities.
	- This summary document should be judiciously updated in the same style when major ideas, insights and developments are hit upon. The filename should be "Mission Phoenix Vision doc v0.0.1" with the numbers updated at appropriate iterations. However, I'm unclear what type of change each number should represent, what the criteria is for each change.
	- The role of Claude AI with respect to this document and the mission-vision is
		- Mission planning and organizing assistant
		  collapsed:: true
			- I am trying to accomplish a lot. Occasionally I lose sight of the big picture, and why I am doing particular tasks. I also deprioritise and delay some tasks and activities in the short time even though they are essential for long-term success (eg. physical rehab routine ).
			- You are to keep track of the big picture while also help organise the day-to-day, and therefore every scale in between.
			- Prioritization is therefore key, as is time-blocking and balance.
		- Software development planner and programmer.
			- I have a very basic, low-level familiarity with programming, coding, AI tools and terminology. I did consider major, intense up-skilling in this area but decided against it given the abilities of AI tools in this area now.
			- I have a basic familiarity with things like Github, VScode, command line but still need quite detailed instructions and steps.
			- You are to suggest apps, technologies, platforms, frameworks, tools that we shall weigh up together given our projects' requirements and development pathway. This may also include strongly recommending I change my workflows and workflow tools for higher productivity and performance. I am open to learning and re-learning. This may also include commercial, private, licensed tools which require purchase/payment, as well as free and open-source tools.
			- This should also include recommendation of AI tools that are not Claude AI or related, and/or not created by Anthropic. I will value your suggestions more highly, and return for further and continued guidance, if/when you can recognise your limitations and when another non-Anthropic tool may be better suited to a task.
		- Research assistant.
		  collapsed:: true
			- We are dealing with complex issues while drowning in a sea of information that is of dramatically varying quality, usefulness and accuracy. You are to source and cite high-quality articles, videos, websites, reports, audio etc that can help answer our questions.
			- Keep in mind that we are working on the frontiers of knowledge and wisdom with a focus on Truth, truth, kindness, healing and helpfulness. This involves open-mindedness along with rigour, dealing with alternative models, 'conspiracy' theories and fringe theories. Consensus ≠ truth. Orthodoxy ≠ correctness. Ubiquity ≠ accuracy. Well-known sources (eg. Wikipedia, mainstream media, academia) need to be questioned and critiqued as much as the fringe.
			- Multiple definitions of the problem. Myriad views of the issue. We want to acknowledge the many sides of an issue, the various claims, as well as counter-claims, backed up with evidence and articulating the reasoning.
		- Exercise physiologist, physical therapist and expert rehab trainer.
		- Learning coach, teacher.
		  collapsed:: true
			- I want to learn and grow in doing all this. You can join dots, make connections, uncover insights and communicate these along the way.
		- A gentle mirror, mentor and minder.
		  collapsed:: true
			- I will have major resistance to all or some of the tasks and activities we need to do. You are to remind me of why we are doing these things, why things are important, and provide helpful insights to assist me getting over the hump.
		- Accountability buddy.
		  collapsed:: true
			- We have work to do, and lots of it. Consistency over quantity. And quantity over quality, initially, with the view that quality will improve with quantity and feedback/reflection. "Don't break the chain." Tracking progress.
		- A self-reflective learning agent. You are to learn and reflect on our interactions for future interactions and tasks, as am I.
		- Questioner and clarifier.
		  collapsed:: true
			- You are to ask questions in order to fill gaps and clarify understanding to successfully fill the above roles.

- ## Vision & Overview
  collapsed:: true
	- ### Long-Term Goal
	  collapsed:: true
		- A portfolio of interconnected websites and applications that are financially self-sustaining, intelectually provocative, spiritually enriching, contribute to the cultivation of peace and prosperity within and across human civilization,
		- All endeavours start as a solo effort by me but are developed and cultivated to become either an "X-C Community", providing a platform for community-driven content creation and sharing, or a sustainable business, or both.
		- A career as consultant, researcher, writer, developer, and entrepreneur in the fields of metaphysics, theology, philosophy, science, technology, and economics.
		- Definition and clarification of such as a role as a "metamechanic" who employs and applies "metamechanica": metaphysics applied to the issues of human civilization.
		- A digital knowledge workflow that allows me to achieve this vision, in the context of a broader balanced life, which stays current with developments in web and digital technologies, and utilises AI and machine learning in a supportive and empowering way, rather than a replacement for human creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving.
	- ### The Metamechanic
	  collapsed:: true
		- metaphysics applied to the human condition, civilization, and the issues of our time, and all times
		- an applied metaphysician as well as an applied metaphysicist
		- uses a toolbox of models, ideas, frameworks to critically and creatively think about questions and problems
		- a consultant called in to help solve complex issues, and offer alternatives
		- tried to always consider or acknowledge the biggest of big pictures: God, Eternity, Mind, Purpose, Meaning, and the nature of Reality
	- ### X-C Communities
	  collapsed:: true
		- Online communities driving growth and development of some of the websites.
		- Could be quite small and tight with very carefully selected employees and experts where everyone knows each other, or could be much broader
		- Has a comprehensive, well-defined set of policies and procedures to maintain high quality content, high-quality discussion and debate, and courteous communication in the face of controversial issues, particularly given that we want to engage fringe, alternative and conspiracy theories and critique them on a case-by-case basis.
		- Users, contributors and administrators must attempt to enact and demonstrate in practice the higher-order spiritual ideals that underlie the project in theory.
		  collapsed:: true
			- I am undecided if contributors must use real names. We don't want people hiding behind aliases and engaging in ways they wouldn't face-to-face or if their real name were known. On the other hand, we don't want people to not contribute for fear of professional blacklisting or personally-directed backlash.
		- "X-C" as shorthand.
		  collapsed:: true
			- "X" for
				- unknown, undefined, or variable.
				- hidden treasure, like the X marks the spot on a treasure map
				- interconnectedness, cross-disciplinary
				- expertise, or X-pertise
			- "C" for
				- community
				- collaboration
				- cartography, as in knowledge cartography, and the mapping of knowledge
				- curation, as in selecting, organizing, and presenting knowledge; not indiscriminate aggregation or presentation of all data;
				- concise
				- critical, as in critical thinking, critical analysis, and critical creativity
				- controversy, as in mapping controversies, debates, and issues
				- courage, to explore the fringe, the unpopular, question assumptions, beliefs and biases
				- compassionate but not cowardly
				- cordial and courteous
		- Mottos, slogans and taglines
		  collapsed:: true
			- All people are equal, but not all ideas are equal.
			- There is a hierarchy of ideas, and some ideas are more powerful than others.

		- The database of interconnected web of data, knowledge, ideas, concepts, frameworks, models, resources, references, summaries, images, videos, visualizations, tools, teachings, and wisdom that underpins the entire portfolio of websites and applications
		- Particular projects may draw on part of this mycelium database, or all of it
		- Mycelium as the metaphor for the interconnectedness of all knowledge, ideas, and concepts that is evolving and growing over time, supporting life and growth in the ecosystem of peace and health
		- Websites and applications are display filters, like the fruiting bodies of the mycelium, providing access to the knowledge and ideas contained within

			- So that more may be more and have more
			- EFA attempts to make the grand issue of scarcity, poverty and prosperity more intellectually digestible by cohering disparate data, siloed expertise and competing analyses into an overarching, sensible narrative. In doing so, it hopes to make the troubling universal phenomenon of poverty more emotionally manageable and pragmatically hopeful.

		- Context: I am almost 50 years old. I sit a lot. I have weak and tight muscles, particularly in my lower back, hips, core and calf muscles. I used to be very sporty and athletic but I am losing it, losing muscle, losing flexibility, losing balance, losing mobility. I haven't been able to jog in 20 years due to lower calf issues. I have had to give up basketball and squash due to lower back issues. I know some deterioration and degeneration is expected, particularly in terms of muscle mass and fitness but I know I can still be in much better shape. Sitting for long periods doing Metamechanic projects is not helping this.

		- Full public operation and open X-C community
	- ### Prioritization of projects and tools
	  collapsed:: true
		- Projects and tools do not have equal priority. Some websites and tools build on, incorporate and/or extend others. Some sites and tools are fundamental. Priority ratings may shift over time but roughly, to begin with, it would look something like this:
		- #### Top Priority
			- Another M-Theory
			- DiaGnosis
			- Enough For All
			- Inner Beginner
			- ACIM Concordance
			- The Metamechanic
			- FORCK shop
			- X-C Communities
			- Coherence App
			- iQubes
			- PDF processor
			- Mycelium notes
		- #### Medium Priority
		  collapsed:: true
			- Adam's Atlas
			- Futures & Foresight Education
			- Global Effort
			- FACTs 4CT
			- Fresh Alternatives
			- Metamechanical AI
			- A Textbook for the Futures
			- Babies, Bibles and Bathwater
			- X-Science
			- The Church of Science
			- Ultimate Conspiracy
		- #### Lower Priority
		  collapsed:: true
			- Australian New Energy Organisation
			- Behind, Below, Beyond
			- Array Attire
			- My Year Without Fear
			- Holonaut
			- The Forgotten Technologies
			- The Psilence of Science
	- Spherical model of prioritization, organization and management
	  collapsed:: true
		- Explanation of the model
		  collapsed:: true
			- Using a layered sphere as a geometric metaphor for operational success and personal fulfilment
			- Entities in inner layers/radii are more important, higher priority, higher power. They are the foundation for outer layers.
			- Entities in outer layers build off, extend or require use of entities "underneath".
		- Purpose of the model
		  collapsed:: true
			- To keep my priorities in order, focused.
			- To not lose sight of the big picture and the biggest picture.
			- To manage workflows and tasks, and to know why when I get lost.
			- Integrates with Coherence app
			-
		- Structure of the model
			- Comprises all aspects of a life and all Parallel Life Streams, not just metamechanic, not just professional. The person makes the professional but the professional only augments the personal. The spiritual underlies all.
			- Parallel Life Streams
				- concurrent, parallel, intertwining aspects of life that have their own projects, tasks, goals. Ideally should complement each other and contribute toward a balanced whole.
				- ACIM Theory, Training, Transcription, Translation (ACIM-4T)
				  collapsed:: true
					- Prayer, meditation, reflection, contemplation
					- Apply, live, forgive
					- Transcribe texts & study
					- Translate language & study
				- MetaMechanic content
					- Write
					- Read
					- Watch-listen
					- Teach-learn
				- WADS - Wisdom Architecture and Data Science
					- Learning and using computer coding, IT, web development, AI tools, data science et al for the identification and promulgation of wisdom
				- Adventure
					- Rehab & Training
						- 5R Rehab Road to
					- Planning & Prepping
					- Travel & Execution
				- GFCC - Gardening, Fixing, Cleaning, Cooking
				- Family & Friends
				- Mission Management
			- A sphere represents a "pyramidal" structure but in all directions, emanating from centre/core. The core is the apex.
			- As you can appreciate, there is a finite number of entities/elements in each layer of the pyramid/sphere, increasing as you go lower down the pyramid, further out in the sphere. It could be something like 1-3-7-13-23 or similar
		- Specifics of the model
			- CORE =
				- spiritual practice;
				- prayer, meditation, contemplation
				- application of ACIM principles to my life, my thoughts, the world, guided by the ACIM principle: "Seek not to change the world; choose instead to change your mind about the world."
				- I must remember my purpose, my function, my keys to happiness and success, my Source: God, forgiveness, the Holy Spirit as my guide and teacher. "Seek first the Kingdom of Heaven and all else will be given un to you." It is this which must guide all actions, all decisions, my state of mind.
			- Beyond this core, layers and its elements build off the ones below. This could change over time. I could also benefit in some guidance and assistance. Some ideas which come to mind though are:
				- ACIM-4T and ACIM Concordance. Understanding and applying the metaphysics, theology, interconnections and contrasts with other theologies, philosophies and systems is central to most of my projects, as well as my personal life. This seems foundational.
